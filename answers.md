In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

    Describe refers to a suite of tests, kind of like a main folder. 
    Every test is within it, it includes a description of what
    is being tested under the main category of describe.

What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

    It forces you to think about what the output of a certain function or component is.
    It helps you understand the purpose of all the functions being written, it also helps
    you to write more thorough code. 

Mention three types of automated tests.

    Unit Testing
    Integration Testing
    Snapshot Testing
